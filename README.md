# Portfolio 2019
Built with ReactJS (create-react-app)

## Basic design
Below is some basic sketch design, I'm not a designer but I can build pretty much anything designed(not by me). <br />
It's supposed to be a basic side bar and main content which is a "slider" that goes through projects. <br />
It is slated to be advanced, support dynamic content from API endpoints(portfolio dashboard) and will include filtering eg. between professional/personal projects.

## Initial sketches

Here I'm just drawing out a sketch, thinking of JSON structure

!['basic content slider'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdc-cunningham/reactjs-portfolio-2019/master/portfolio-2019-slider.jpg)
This is a basic portfolio object slider that will have unique data eg. unique photo slider, skill categories, etc... it's not complete as of 08/06/2019 not to mention the data is populated by placeholder files not APIs.

## Progress updates
