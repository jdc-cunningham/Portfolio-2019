# Portfolio 2019
Built with ReactJS (create-react-app)

## Basic design
Below is some basic sketch design, I'm not a designer but I can build pretty much anything designed(not by me). <br />
It's supposed to be a basic side bar and main content which is a "slider" that goes through projects. <br />
It is slated to be advanced, support dynamic content from API endpoints(portfolio dashboard) and will include filtering eg. between professional/personal projects.
